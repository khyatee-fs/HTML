    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <h2>What is HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</p>
    <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</p>
    <p>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</p>
    <p>HTML consists of a series of elements</p>
    <p>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</p>
    <p>HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
    <h2>Example </h2>
    <p>The <b>DOCTYPE </b> html declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document</p>
    <p>The <b>HTML</b> element is the root element of an HTML page</p>
    <p>The <b>HEAD</b> element contains meta information about the HTML page</p>
    <p>The <b>TITLE</b> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)</p>
    <p>The <b>BODY</b> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</p>
    <p>The <b>h1</b> element defines a large heading</p>   
    <p>The <b>p</b> element defines a paragraph</p>
